      `I've been developing web application since I was 19 years old. After completing my college, it was so hard to find a job as a fresher. After few months I got an opportunity in a start-up company. There I've learned lot of things about web development, JS frameworks, deployments, managing servers and talking to clients.`,
      `After I've started working as freelancer. As a freelancer I've build more than 50+ web applications and couple of mobile applications too.`,
      `But now, I'm a legend. I've been coding in React, React Native, Angular, NextJS, Typescript, Node.js, Express, Fastify, NestJS, WebdriverIO Mocha, Cypress, Selenium, Cucumber, Java, Flutter, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, PHP, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, Figma. Although I barely know the syntax (üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Stack overflow), I consider myself a Ninja developer.`,
